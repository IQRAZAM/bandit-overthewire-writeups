# OverTheWire: Bandit — Writeups & Learnings

This repository contains my detailed writeups for the **OverTheWire Bandit wargame**, a beginner-friendly cybersecurity challenge designed to teach practical Linux, command-line, and cybersecurity fundamentals.

I completed the levels and documented:
- My approach
- Commands used
- Key concepts learned
- Troubleshooting steps
- Clean writeups without revealing passwords

## Why Bandit?
Bandit helps develop essential skills for cybersecurity, including:

- Linux command-line proficiency  
- File permissions & privilege concepts  
- Searching hidden files  
- Using `grep`, `find`, `strings`  
- SSH usage  
- Base64, rot13, hexdumps  
- Environment variables  
- Cron jobs  
- Simple privilege escalation logic  
- Working with unusual file types  

These challenges helped me practice real-world thinking used in CTFs, penetration testing, and security operations.
