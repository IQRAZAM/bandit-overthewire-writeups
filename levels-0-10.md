# Bandit Levels 0–10 — Writeup & Learnings

This document contains my solutions, approaches, and learnings for **Bandit Levels 0–10**.  
Passwords are not shown for security reasons (you should practice it by yourself for better understandings.)
Before starting we need to learn how to login and start finding the passwords for level for that purpose we have level 0 .
Goal of this level

You need to log into the Bandit server using SSH.

Host: bandit.labs.overthewire.org

Port: 2220

Username: bandit0

Password: bandit0

Once you log in, you’re inside a remote Linux machine as user bandit0.

The whole point of Level 0 is:
Learn how to use SSH to connect to a remote server.

Nothing more. No searching files, no commands — just connecting.

**What does “non-standard port” mean?**

Normally, SSH uses port 22.

But Bandit uses port 2220 to avoid conflicts.

So instead of:
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
You must connect using a different port:
ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org

**What happens after logging in?**

You’ll see something like:

bandit0@bandit:~$


This means:

You are inside the Bandit server

You are logged in as user bandit0

You can now work inside this remote Linux environment

You are ready for Level 1
## **Level 0 → 1**

### Objective  
SSH into the remote machine and retrieve the password in the `readme` file.

### Approach  
Use the provided port (2220), connect via SSH, list files, and read the file.

###  Commands
```bash
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
ls
cat readme

 Learning
Basics of SSH

Listing files

Reading file content


Level 1 → 2
 Objective
File named - must be read.
 Approach
Use path notation ./- to avoid confusion with command options.This step is very helpful.
 Commands
ls
cat ./-

 Learning
How Linux handles filenames starting with - ( very important )


Using relative paths.This helped me to understand how we can access files and how files are being arranged and can be accessed .



Level 2 → 3
 Objective
Find the file with spaces in its name.
 Approach
Escape spaces using quotes or backslashes.
 Commands
ls
cat "spaces in this filename"

 Learning
Handling filenames with spaces , making it easier to understand different file names .



Level 3 → 4
 Objective
Find a hidden file.
 Approach
Use ls -a to list hidden files.
 Commands
ls -a
cat .hidden

 Learning
Hidden files start with . (very important )



Level 4 → 5
 Objective
File containing human-readable text among many.
 Approach
Use file command to identify file type.
 Commands
ls
file ./*
cat <filename>

 Learning
Using file to detect data types



Level 5 → 6
 Objective
Find a file with specific permissions and size.
 Approach
Use find with conditions.
 Commands
find . -type f -size 1033c -group bandit6 -user bandit6
cat <path>

 Learning
Using find with filters



Level 6 → 7
 Objective
Find a readable file owned by user bandit7, group bandit6.
 Approach
Search from root directory with permission suppression.
 Commands
find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 2>/dev/null
cat <file>

 Learning
Search entire system


Suppress permission errors



Level 7 → 8
 Objective
Find password inside a file containing the word "millionth".
 Approach
Use grep to search.
💻 Commands
grep "millionth" data.txt

 Learning
Using grep to search within files



Level 8 → 9
 Objective
Find unique line in a huge file.
 Approach
Sort and use uniq.
 Commands
sort data.txt | uniq -u

 Learning
Sorting + filtering unique values



Level 9 → 10
 Objective
File contains binary data mixed with text.
 Approach
Use strings to extract readable text and filter unusual pattern.
 Commands
strings data.txt | grep "="

 Learning
Using strings to analyze binary files



Level 10 → 11
 Objective
File is base64-encoded.
 Approach
Decode the file.
 Commands
cat data.txt | base64 --decode

 Learning
Base64 decoding in Linux
